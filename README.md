Add every hash in the basket and calculate the highest factor, maybe the higher the factor the more difficult?, then search the user who's hash gives a remainder of 0 when divided by that highest remainder.

That should give real consensus.

When a certain threshold is reached for the size of a block, the user with the remainder of zero is searched, and the block is signed by that user's hash and added to the blockchain.

Maybe the closest to 0 remainder suffices to sign a block/basket.

When 2 competing basket's reach consensus at the same time, no signing will be performed and a new basket will be formed.
